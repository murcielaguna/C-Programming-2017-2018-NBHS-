//Simple code to calculate the length of a square. Asks the user for input. A = s^2, or A = height * width is the formula. Since this is a square, you only need to ask for one input, as all sides are equal length by default

using namespace std;

    cout << "Please input the length of the side: " << endl;
    cin >> side;

    int area = side * side;
